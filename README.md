# From Bugs to Build

From Bugs to Build is a personal knowledge base documenting what I learned while studying full-stack development.

This project focuses on real problems I encountered, why they happened, and how I solved them, including code snippets I can reuse and explanations I wish I had when I started.

The goal is to serve as:
- A personal reference
- A learning resource for other developers
- A mentoring tool I can share in the future
